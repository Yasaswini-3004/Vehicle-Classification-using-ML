# Vehicle-Classification-using-ML
This project entitled "Vehicle Classification Using ML". I have considered a dataset which contains the explanation of various parameters with respect to 4 vehicles namely a double decker bus, Chevrolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400 cars. I have compared their performance using some Machine Learning models.
